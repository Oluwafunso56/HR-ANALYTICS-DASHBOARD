Here is the revised statement:

"Here is my submission on the HR dataset analysis. The dataset consists of employee information such as attrition, age, education, job satisfaction, business travel, and department. I applied DAX measures to calculate the attrition rate and the count of active employees, with an average age of 37.

Insights:

R&D had the highest sum of attrition count at 282, followed by Sales at 186 and HR at 24. R&D accounted for 57.32% of the total attrition count.
Life Sciences had the highest sum of attrition count at 190, which was 1,257.14% higher than Human Resources, the department with the lowest attrition count at 14. Life Sciences accounted for 38.62% of the total attrition count.
Across all 6 education fields, the sum of attrition count ranged from 14 to 190.
Recommendations:
R&D: With the highest attrition count and percentage, it is crucial to investigate the underlying causes of attrition in the R&D department. Implement retention strategies such as providing career development opportunities, competitive compensation packages, and a positive work environment to reduce attrition and retain valuable talent.

Life Sciences: Address the high attrition count in the Life Sciences field to ensure the retention of skilled professionals. Offer opportunities for professional growth, work-life balance initiatives, and create a supportive and engaging workplace culture to mitigate attrition.

By focusing on these areas with the highest attrition counts and percentages, organizations can work towards reducing turnover rates, retaining talented employees, and maintaining a stable workforce."
